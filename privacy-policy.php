            <h3>6. Use of Cookies
            </h3>
            <p>The KVCH Web site use “cookies” to help you personalize your online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a Web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies
                are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.
            </p>
            <p>One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you personalize KVCH pages, or register
                with KVCH site or services, a cookie helps KVCH to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of recording your personal information, such as billing addresses, shipping addresses, and so on. When
                you return to the same KVCH Web site, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the KVCH features that you customized.
            </p>
            <p>You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully
                experience the interactive features of the KVCH services or Web sites you visit.</p>
            <h3>7. Changes to this Statement
            </h3>
            <p>KVCH will occasionally update this Statement of Privacy to reflect company and customer feedback. KVCH encourages you to periodically review this Statement to be informed of how KVCH is protecting your information.</p>
