                <h3>DevOps: What Does It Mean ?</h3>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <p>DevOps is an approach to software development and IT operations that emphasises open lines of communication and teamwork to better align technology initiatives with organisational objectives. Although many see it as such, DevOps is not a piece of technology. In its place, the word DevOps has emerged from the merger of its two precursors, Development and Operations.</p>
                </div>

                <h3>Are there any prerequisites for joining DevOps certification Training ?</h3>

                <h3>How much does a certified DevOps engineer earns ?</h3>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <p>You can make approximately ₹4,00,000 per year. However, as you gain experience as a DevOps engineer, your salary will also increase. A senior DevOps engineer can earn around ₹7,00,000-₹11,00,000 per annum.</p>
                </div>

                <h3>Does the employment programme guarantee me a job ?</h3>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <p>Apparently not. If you need help finding employment, our program exists to make that a reality for you. It's a chance to see what kind of lucrative opportunities the business world has to offer and locate a career that fits your skills and experience. Your chances of being hired will always come down to how well you do in the interview and how well you fit the needs of the recruiter.</p>
