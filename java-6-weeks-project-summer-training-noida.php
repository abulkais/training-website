                                <li><b> Platform independence:</b> Java&#39;s &quot;write once, run anywhere&quot; philosophy allows
                                    developers to build applications that can run on different platforms without the need
                                    for major modifications, making it a preferred choice for cross-platform development.</li>
                                <li><b> Strong community support:</b> Java has a large and active developer community that
                                    contributes to its growth and continuous improvement. This community provides
                                    resources, libraries, frameworks, and support for developers, making it easier to learn
