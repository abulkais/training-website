Inversion of Control and decoupling from application code are two elements that contribute to the system's ease of management and testing. It allows for aspect-oriented programming, which makes applications more modular and facilitates their consistent growth. That's why even such prestigious institutions as MIT, Fitbit, VISA, AMEX, ESPN, and eBay have used Spring Framework.

                            <p>Spring Boot is a legal open-source micro-framework maintained by Pivotal. Additionally, this technology gives Java programmers a legitimate base from which to launch an automatically customizable, enterprise-ready Spring application. To establish a reasonable judgement of Spring Boot, familiarity with Spring is required.</p>
                            <p>To be more specific, Spring Boot shortens the code size of the Spring framework and provides you with the simplest means of building an application with minimal settings.

                <h3>Why should I study Spring Framework ?</h3>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <p>The capabilities and availability of the Java Spring Framework have contributed to its rising popularity over time. Inversion of Control and decoupling from application code are two elements that contribute to the system's ease of management and testing. It allows for aspect-oriented programming, which makes applications more modular and facilitates their consistent growth. That's why even such prestigious institutions as MIT, Fitbit, VISA, AMEX, ESPN, and eBay have used Spring Framework. Companies need Spring Framework experts to use the framework's predefined templates for consistent and rapid development. There is no better way to start your career as a software developer than by taking Spring Certification Training.</p>
                </div>

                <h3>Is there a recommended course of study for mastering Spring Framework ?</h3>
                <div class="faq-item">

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <p>Since Java is one of the most widely used programming languages, and since Spring is one of the most widely used open source Java platforms, the need for the Spring framework will likely remain constant. Numerous large technology companies are on the lookout for Spring-certified employees because of the platform's extensive infrastructure support for the speedy and straightforward development of reliable Java applications.

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <p>New features in Spring 5 Framework, such as functional programming with Kotlin, a Reactive Programming Model, enhanced testing, and library support, ensure that Spring will remain the most popular framework. Having knowledge of Spring Framework is a must if you want to make a living as a software developer, since its popularity is only likely to increase.</p>
                </div>

                <h3>How much do Spring Framework certified experts make on average ?</h3>
