            <h3 style="text-align:center; font-size:30px; font-weight:600;">CCNA Training <b style="color:#cc0f0f;"> <span>FAQs</span> </b> </h3>
            <div class="faq-accordion">

                <h3>What is CCNA ?</h3>
                <div class="faq-item">
                <p>The term "CCNA" stands for "Cisco Certified Network Associate." This is a certification that Cisco gives to people who have knowledge and skills in basic networking, accessing a network, IP services, IP connectivity, automation, security fundamentals, switching, routers, WAN technologies, and programming.</p>
                </div>

               <h3>What kind of jobs can you get with a CCNA ?</h3>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <p>Over the years, the CCNA Certification has grown. If you go back far enough, there was only one CCNA Certification. But in 2013, the field of certification grew a lot to meet the needs of different people. A CCNA Professional who is certified is one of the most sought-after candidates in the industry today. A Cisco Certified professional can expect to make between Rs. 3,50,000 and Rs. 4,50,000 per year on average.</p>

                </div>

                <h3>Who can take the CCNA Course at KVCH ?</h3>
                <div class="faq-item">

                    <p>Anyone with a bachelor's degree or higher who wants to start a career in networking can sign up for the CCNA course at KVCH. But professionals like Network Engineers and Administrators would benefit more from this course.</p>

                </div>

               <h3>Is the training time flexible for working professionals ?</h3>
                <div class="faq-item">
                   <p>Yes, we have flexible course timings. You can contact our support team to get detailed knowledge about the batch's timing which suits you.</p>
                </div>

                <h3>Will my queries be solved if I face any during the course ?</h3>
                <div class="faq-item">
                  <p>Our students are our utmost priority and we provide round the clock support for your queries.</p>
                </div>

               <h3>Will I receive a certificate after training ?</h3>
                <div class="faq-item">
                 <p>Yes, we provide certificate post completion of the course, recognising your achievement as a CCNA expert.</p>
                </div>


                <h3>Does the placement assistance provide me Job guarantee ?</h3>
                <div class="faq-item">
                  <p>Apparently not. If you need help finding employment, our program exists to make that a reality for you. It's a chance to see what kind of lucrative opportunities the business world has to offer and locate a career that fits your skills and experience.
