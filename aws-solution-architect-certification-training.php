                            <p>AWS's popularity is mostly attributable to the scalability options it offers clients, which allow them to change their consumption while keeping costs in check. In addition, AWS gives the tools necessary to develop a company from the beginning. Here are a few of AWS's characteristics that contribute to its popularity:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li> Associate AWS Certified Solutions Architects have an average pay of $121,292, which is more than the average compensation of the top 15 IT-certified professionals.</li>
                                <li> AWS cloud occupations unrelated to design are compensated less than architect positions.</li>
                                <li> In locations with a strong demand for AWS professionals, such as Austin, San Francisco, Washington, and Boston, wages are 25 percent more than the national average.</li>
                                <li> Becoming a certified AWS solutions architect will prepare you for all aspects of transferring an on-premises application to the AWS cloud.</li>
